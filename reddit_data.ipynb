This year, many crypto currency will cease to exist.\\n\\nAs more eyes and informed investors enter the market, this will pave way for strong crypto/blockchain company to spring out ahead in this market.\\n\\nEven though there might be an expectation for the market to readjust and correct to lower levels, the result of these corrections are a good thing for the overall crypto economy. What we expect, \"a cold winter\", is that this correction, if it happens, will essentially WIPE out all the scam projects and weak projects from the market -> therefore raising the overall longterm value of the market.\\n\\nMy suggestion to some of the newer people entering this market will be to do your DUE DILIGENCE! Some of the people here will agree that the crypto markets is by far the most stressful market to \"play/invest\" in. Really do your market analysis and research before putting a LARGE sum of money into the market. With the increased level of unpredictability we will be  experiencing this coming year, many coins will be left in the dust. You do not want to be caught on the bad end of the market with some of these companies. \\n\\nI-HODL = Informed-HODLS only',\n",

Here is his latest blog post:\\n\\nhttp://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2018/01/02/why-bitcoin-is-stupid/\\n\\n\"Bitcoin is Stupid\" is self-explanatory as to the direction of the post. Clearly, the frustration is with bitcoin (possibly other alts) as an irresponsible speculative investment. For those who have decided to read this article, does this MMM blog post share a potential general public view point that in North America there is a strong sentiment to steer away from crypto*currencies* and focus more on blockchian networks (ETH or Neo's of the world) \\n\\n   \n",

       "1179068  It'll almost certainly reach $9200-9400 again soon, likely over the weekend or even in 24-36hours, but I'd say it'll hit $9800 again even if not. \\n\\nThere's nothing fundamentally pushing bitcoin (or any cryptos) up right now. There's no hype aside from people who were already in. There's no new announcements that are truly exciting or game-changing. Technically (TA wise) we're due for a small correction and may even have a 5th wave down to 5-6k, although the latter seems less likely now that we've broke 10k.\\n\\nTo be a buyer right now, **especially** after the **ridiculously obvious and disgusting price manipulation** on this latest run-up from 9k is just plain stupid and you must be comfortable with a 10-20% down-tick overnight if you're going to hold this bag. You're **completely** at the whim of whatever/whoever did these legs up, and they/it are not in it for bitcoin or crypto but rather accumulating (typically fiat) capital. **They have no qualms with opening a huge short on ...   \n",

Seems to be a gap in this miracle system.\\n\\nConsider that people make fake SD cards for a few dollars each complete with perfect holograms on the packaging. So how hard is it to copy an RFID tag? It's difficult to see blockchain being the answer to this. Other logistical supply chain problems perhaps, but I struggle to see it preventing counterfeiting.   \n",
